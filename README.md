# lineage_tree_store

A little couple-hour project, experimenting with a store of data that allows you to add arbitrary data values (byte sequences), and separately, describe other data that can be computed by way of functional application. The store allows you to add data without having a known lineage, add lineages without computing the data, but always trying to keep them in sync as much as possible.
